## OWASP considerations

As a team, we have decided that the OWASP security consideration examples that
are most appicaple are:

- Input validation: With proper input validation,
- Authentication and access controls,
- Logging and monitoring,
- Vulnerabilities management,
- Least privilege.

With input validation, you are able to detect and prevent malicious or
unintended data from system user from being entered into the system.

Implementing authentication and access control is crucial in maintaining
security of a system as it ensures that authorized individuals are granted
access to the system and it's information.

Logging and monitoring are important as they enable tracking of system activity.
This allows for prompt detection and response to security breaches.

Vulnerability management helps developers to identify and assess vulnerabilities
in their systems and take appropriate actions to eliminate them.

System developlent using least privilege principle limits access to system resources
and functionalities to only essential users.
